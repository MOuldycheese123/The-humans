    <h1 style="font-size: 25px;"> 
After the success of the first crusade, many kingdoms, principalities, and counties formed near the holy cities, which countered the Islamic states, as it acted as a buffer, but there were many problems within these Christian states that were not addressed properly, which later acted as their weakness. </h1>

  <li>There was a chronic shortage of manpower between these Christian nations, as not many experienced soldiers, knights, and nobles would abandon their homes to travel such a long distance away from Europe, all the way to the Levant region.</li>
      
  <li>The support and aid from the European and western powers were insufficient for the crusader states, as these western states had their own domestic conflicts and ambitions going on. </li>
      
  <li>After the first crusades, the relationship between the crusader states and the Byzantines was distanced, as the Byzantines wanted the crusader states to become subordinate to them. The Byzantine’s original command to the crusader states was to capture and hand over the holy cities to them, which was broken. That led to the long-term tensions between the two.</li>
      
    <li>Earlier in the first crusade, the Muslim powers were divided, not well-equipped comparatively, and didn’t have a sufficient understanding of western battle tactics, which led to their downfall. Now, the Muslims were slowly unifying, had better equipped artillery and armies, and had adopted counter-attacks to the crusaders' tactics.</li> 
</ul> 
 <h2> The Christian states could get military aid in defeating the powers, and another religious enthusiasm was ignited. The most notable success of the Crusaders was the siege of Lisbon, where they successfully recaptured the city of Lisbon from the Moorish overlords, who were Muslims. Despite the fact that the crusaders had recaptured Lisbon, the Spanish and Portuguese were still spectacles and were not as serious about this holy war.Another secondary crusade started happening, called the Welsh Crusade. The pope declared that any Christian conquering of any non-Christian land counted as a part of the Crusade. Many ordinary people, such as the Christian Gemran and the Danish, became involved in this war because they believed that being a part of a holy war would atone for all of their sins.As this was also considered a holy war, the Germans and Danish began conquering the eastern pagan cities, saving them from eternal damnation in hell.The secondary fronts seemed successful for the Christians, but the main front (the Middle East) was quite the opposite.
 
The main crusade , directed by kind louis 7th  and King Conrad 3rd at the middle east  were very much displaced, unorganized and the crusaders  had a vague, unclear idea of an objective. King Conrad’s army arrived a whole year before  than king Louis’s army, and the arrival was not as welcomed as expected. Conrad’s nephew, Fredrick Barbarossa got in an encounter with the Byzantines, which soured the relations furthermore. After this coflict between the Gemran and the Byzantines, the Byzanitne Emporer ought to get Conrad and his army out of his territory. Because the Byzantines had established some territorial control in Anabatic, he drove the Crusaders out on the eastern front.Rather than marching along the eastern coast of Anatolia or even waiting for King Louis , Conrad decides to attack the heart of the Seljuk empire and march towards the Seljuk capital, the city of Nonya. This proved to be a great mistake, as Conrad neither had a big enough army to defeat the Seljuks nor any soldiers as well-equipped as the Seljuks. The German crusaders suffered a crushing defeat by the Seljuks, to which they later retreated to Constantinople. Conrad was injured and most of his army was killed or sold into slavery by the Seljuks  Conrad was able to escape to Constantinople with the aid of Manuel, and dwited for King Louis to form a better conducted crusade. As said before, there wasn’t a set objective for the Second Crusade, and they had a discussion about what they should capture. They eventually decided to join the local attacks against the Muslim city of Damascus, and this would’ve been a fairly strong move, if they succeeded. The siege fell apart due to different factions' breaking apart and domestic conflicts among the locals, crusaders,etc.

The result of the Second crusade was an absolute catastrophe for the western powers. The crusaders hadn’t won anything thing and were even harassed by the arab apowers as they retreated. Relationship between the Byzantines and the western powers had soured even more, as Manuel was blamed for the defeat, for not aiding the crusaders enough against the muslims. The later ambition and recruitement for further crusades was no longer there and Damascuss was no longer allied with the Byzantines. The kingdom of Jerusalem formed an alliance with the
