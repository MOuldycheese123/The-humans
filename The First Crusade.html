    <b style="colour:white; font-size: 20px; colour;"> Tensions were brewing up between the Christian European states and the Muslims states, it got even worse when the Seljuk Turks (Central Asian Turks who later converted to Sunni Islam) attacked the Byzantine Empire’s eastern Mediterranean  front, Anatolia (modern day Turkey). In 1071, the Great Seljuk Turks attacked the Byzantine Empire in the battle Manzikert, and inflicted a crushing defeat upon the byzantines. They conquered most of Anatolia and took cities with rich Christian history, like Nicea and Antioch. After the  coming three   decades, the Great Seljuk Sultan, Maik Shah died, which made the domestic states within start to fight each other for power and local warlords started attacking and plundering the Byzantine territory. Byzantine emperor, Alexis 1st Comnenus, sent a letter to the Pope Urban 2, for an appeal for military aid to his fellow Christian states against the Muslims. Pope Urban 2 saw this aid as a form of unification between the division of the western church and the eastern church in Europe, and to strengthen his religious authority over the people. He saw this conflict as a opportunity to unify Christianity, showing them a common enemy who had claimed and conquered their holy sites. </b>

    <b style="colour:white; font-size: 20px;">The pope preached a sermon among all Christian clergies,nobles, knights soldiers,etc to aid their brother Christian empire and free their holy sites (most importantly Jerusalem) from Muslim rule. At the sermon. Pope Urban declared whoever fights in this holy battle, shall be forgiven and cleansed of all their sins, hoping that the soldiers who often feared eternal damnation of hell because of the violent live that they lived, would join. This sermon given by the pope, uplifted and exhilarated the Christians to such an ambition that Christian states sent out an army of 60,000 soldiers to “liberate” Jerusalem and other holy sites. The Muslim states in MENA and central Asian region had quite been weakened. The 2 biggest Muslims states, The great Seljuk empire were Sunnis while the Fatimid caliphates were Shia, causing a drift between the empires. The Christian states had better armoury, artillery, bigger army and such religious unification over an objective that Muslims states were overwhelmed with the Christian crusades that started. None of the Muslims had any idea or understanding how big this crusade was, which was one of the weak points, as later on they were immensely overwhelmed by the Christian army. The Christian sates went on to conquer Tarsus, Antioch, Odessa,etc, but their objective was still not over. Due to the weakening of the Seljuks due to the crusades and the instability that they faced, Jerusalem went to the Fatimid empire, which was the Christian crusader's main objective. As they marched to the holy city of Jerusalem, all the village's people were gone, wells were poisoned and lands became dried, which was done by the Fatimids to weaken and starve the Christian crusades as much as they could. The holy city was guarded on each side by Muslims, and it was almost impossible to enter the gates without a crushing defeat. The aid of ships coming from the pope and the byzantines was blockaded by the Fatimids, so they took apart the ships and sneaked the timber to the Christian crusaders, hoping for any chance of achieving their goal. The Christians built 2 siege towers from the timber coming from the sea and gathered near their environment. They placed the 2 siege towers on the opposite sides of the city’s wall, from which they could directly attack the Muslim adversaries. The Muslim were shocked and prepared from this attack from the Christians, which led to the victory of the Christian crusades. After the victory, Jerusalem and many other holy Christian cities became different states, principality, and counties.<b>
