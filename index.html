  <i style="font-size:25px;">The Crusades were a series of interfaith conflicts between
    Christians and Muslims that
    were largely waged to seize control of crucial locations revered by both faiths. Between 1096 and 1291, eight
    significant Crusade expeditions of different size, power, and degree of success took place. The expensive, bloody,
    and frequently brutal wars raised the stature of European Christians and made them significant players in the Middle
    Eastern land wars. In total, over 8 major crusades took place during 1095 â€“ 1291 BCE and several other minor crusades happend even after.
